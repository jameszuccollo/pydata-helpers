pydatafuncs
===========

Useful functions for working with data in Python.

## Scraper

For anyone who has had the frustration of trying to import official time series. The functions here will pull your desired series into a pandas dataframe. This functionality is gradually being replaced by Quandl, but not all ONS and BoE series are available there. 

Scrapers are available here for ONS, BoE, and IMF data.
